# Project-Tracker

Bluewave Tracker Version 1.0

This will be used in customer's Orgs to help with UAT/Timebanks etc, to help us track issues and changes.

V1.0, will be updated in due course.

This can be deployed using Gearset.

Some setup is required upon install, mainly to update picklists with relevant team members involved in the project.

**Jonathan is currently working on getting this into a second generation package 2021-06-25 17.51.22**
