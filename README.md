# Project-Tracker

Bluewave Tracker Version 1.0 (Unlocked Package 2nd Gen)

This will be used in customer's Orgs to help with UAT/Timebanks etc, to help us track issues and changes.

**It can be installed using the link below which will install the tracker as an unlocked package:**
https://sforce.co/3h725aZ

It will ask for an install key you can use: **test1234**

Install for admins only, and then assign permission sets to grant access.

This link will always bring the latest version of the package and you can reinstall to update the app.

Some setup is required upon install, mainly to update picklists with relevant team members involved in the project. (We plan to make this easier going forward)

1. Assign Permission sets (Admins and Users)
2. Update the Assigned bluewave employee (Global Value Set)
3. Create a phase (Mark as as active)
4. Create a Project (Mark as active)
5. Carry out a quick test

Any questions show be directed to either Jonathan White or Kashif Hussain
